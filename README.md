# Team 5 User-Guides

This repository stores all of our team's user-guides in its Wiki section. There are five user-guides. One for GitHub, AWS, Linux,
SQL, and Java JDBC. These user-guides are fairly detailed, but not overal complex. For the most part they are comprehensive and
designed with clarity in mind. Each user-guide was maintained by a different team member.
